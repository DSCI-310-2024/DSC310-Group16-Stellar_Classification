# Project Title: Stellar Classification Predictor

Contributors: Aron Bahram, Olivia Lam, Lucy Liu, and Viet Ngo

# Project Summary 

Our project looks towards the skies to classify stars to their given spectral types according to their different electromagnetic radiation magnitudes. Our goal is to expand our understanding of stars through their five radiation band types, and explore how data analysis can further our knowledge beyond our galaxy through the study of photometry, dynamics of celestial bodies, and stellar interactions. Our research comes from a data set on planetary systems from NASAâ€™s Exoplanet Archive. Our simple categorization of stars may seem small, but it contributes to the bigger pursuit of celestial research and perhaps even planetary exploration.

# How to Run Our Analysis

1. Clone our Repository from Github:
   
   `git clone https://github.com/DSCI-310-2024/DSCI-310-Group-16.git`

2. Navigate to the Root of Your Project Directory:
   
   `cd [insert project directory name]`
   
3. Create and activate our Environment from its YAML File:
   
   `conda env create --file environment.yml`
   
   `conda activate dsci-310-group16`
   
5. Open Jupyterlab and Run the `spectral_type_classification` Notebook
